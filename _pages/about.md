I'm a sophomore undergraduate at JohnClass 2023, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). As an undergraduate research intern, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) at [RHOS](https://mvig-rhos.com/). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Embodied AI, multimodal perception and learning.
